      august 2023: Mukilteo Coffee Roasters
    </p>
    <p class="text-base font-medium text-slate">
      The coffee you have received this month is Mukilteo Coffee Roasters'
      signature “Mukilteo” blend. Full-bodied and rich without bitterness, the
      flavor is broad and tangy, with great aromatic dimension.
      <br />
      <br />
      Mukilteo Coffee Roasters began in the early '80s, when two PNW coffee
      icons, Gary Smith and Beth Korvin fell in love and decided to combine
      their passions and begin their own coffee business together. This family
      owned company, located on Whidbey Island, WA slow-roasts small batches
      using coffee they source directly from the South American farmers that
      grow it. Mukilteo has a storied history when it comes to roasting; their
      lead roasters are Tim McCormack, one of the original roasters for
      Starbucks, and Dismas Smith, who was the first North American Barista
      Champion. No technology is used in the roasting process, it's all done by
      sight and skill in vintage Probat roasters. Beth got her start in the
      business alongside Jim Stewart, in the founding of Seattle's Best Coffee.
      Using all of this expertise, Mukilteo provides what they call “the best
      coffee in the northwest” to their customers. Sadly, Gary died of cancer at
      the age of 69 in March of 2023, but his family and the community that
      their brand has built will continue on in his memory.

      The coffee was purchased at Mas Cafe in Wallingford. This small local cafe
      is very popular with people who live in the area as a morning
      coffee/breakfast spot, and if they're someone who works from home, lunch
      as well. The cafe serves a variety of Mexican-inspired dishes, including
      their bestseller, the breakfast burrito.
